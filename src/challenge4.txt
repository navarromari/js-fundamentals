- First class functions are functions that behave like a variable. 
- In javascript that means that those functions can be assigned to other variables, passed as an argument or returned by another function.

function longerGreet (name, greet){
    return `${greet(name)}! How are you?`;
}

- When you declare a function you're only defining what that function should do when it is called and what it requires to work (parameters). 

function greet (name){
    return `Hi, ${name}`;
}

When you are calling a function you're asking it to do what you programmed it to do, and you are supposed to give it (as an argument) what it requires to function. 

greet('Mariana');
